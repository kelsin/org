* Le Havre
** Notes
   * First introduction of upgradable resources
   * Gets variability from the order of resource offers, order of building
     proposals, and special buildings available
   * I've only played this game solo in order to practice the rules!
** Goals
   The goal is to have the most wealth at the end of the game

   Wealth comes from:
   * Value of your buildings that you own
   * Money on hand
** Structure
*** Each Round
    * 7 turns, clockwise around the table
    * Each turn you place your ship on the next free ship circle
    * You add to whatever resource offer is shown on that space
    * You then take your action:
      1. You can take all of the resources on one of the offers
      2. You may use a building with your worker disk
*** End of Round
    At the end of the round we do the following steps:
    * Possibly have a harvest:
      * If you have at least one grain, get another
      * If you have at least two cows, get another
    * Feed your workers based on the value on the round card
    * Round card becomes a ship
** Setup
