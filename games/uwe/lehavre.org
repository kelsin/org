* Le Havre
** Notes
   * First introduction of upgradable resources
   * Gets variability from the order of resource offers, order of building
     proposals, and special buildings available
   * I've only played this game solo in order to practice the rules!
** Goals
   The goal is to have the most wealth at the end of the game

   Wealth comes from:
   * Value of your buildings that you own
   * Value of special buildings (like the bank) that have a plus icon
   * Money on hand - 7 francs for each unpaid loan
** Structure
*** Each round
    * 7 turns, clockwise around the table
    * Each turn you place your ship on the next free ship circle
    * You add to whatever resource offer is shown on that space
    * You then take your action by doing one of the following:
      1. You can take all of the resources on one of the offers
      2. You may use a building with your worker disk
    * You can also buy and sell any number of buildings at any time on your turn
*** End of round
    At the end of the round we do the following steps:
    * Possibly have a harvest:
      * If you have at least one grain, get another
      * If you have at least two cows, get another
    * Feed your workers based on the value on the round card
    * The town might construct a new building
    * Round card becomes a ship
*** After last round
    Each player takes ONE more main action (no buying or selling) and players
    may use a building that is already in use
** Setup
   1. Each play takes a ship, a player marker and a summary card
   2. Place the 7 supply tiles face down on their spaces randomly
   3. Based on the game type set up the resources and put out starting offers
   4. Based on game type give players starting resources
   5. Setup buildings
   6. Setup round cards
