**** Traveling
     Player chooses a place to travel and places the Merkator token then (can be
     the same place the current token is and is still considered a new
     travel).

     2. Place new goods on locations based on the rules
     3. Pay or take time counters
     4. Loss of goods check (we aren't playing with this rule)
**** Fulfill contracts

        the supply
     2. The reward in a contract of the next level up

    * Forced investment doesn't happen
    * Players get time counters from the supply
** Setup
