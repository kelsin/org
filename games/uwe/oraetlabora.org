* Ora et Labora
** Notes
   * First introduction of the Rondel
   * Game is hard to get a copy of at the moment
   * No variability (like Caverna), big sandbox!
   * I have not ever played this game!
   * Has two modes of play: Ireland and France
** Goals
** Structure
*** Resources
    * Whenever you get resources, the amount that you get is where that resource
      is on the rondel, this is shared between players
    * You can use the joker resource instead of the real resource if you need
*** Each Turn
    * At the begginning of each turn you get all of your workers back IF they are
      all currently used
    * When building a new building, if your Prior is not currently used, you can
      use him on the building for an immediate (and free) building action
** Setup
