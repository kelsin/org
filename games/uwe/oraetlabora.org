* Ora et Labora
** Notes
   * First introduction of the Rondel
   * Game is hard to get a copy of at the moment
   * Has two modes of play: Ireland and France
   * No variability (like Caverna), big sandbox!
   * I have not ever played this game!
** Goals
   The goal is to have the highest score at the end of the game:
   * Add up all points on your good tiles
   * Add the economic value of all buildings and settlements
   * Score settlements using dwelling values
** Structure
   The game plays over 25 rounds

*** Resources
    * Whenever you get resources, the amount that you get is where that resource
      is on the rondel, this is shared between players
    * You can use the joker resource instead of the real resource if you need
*** Course of a Round
    1. At the begginning of each turn you get all of your workers back IF they
       are all currently used
    2. Turn the production wheel one space
    3. Check for settlement phase
    4. Each player gets one action (clockwise order) and then the starting
       player gets a second action
    5. Starting player passes to the next player
*** Player Actions
    * Use a building
      * Use your own clergymen
      * You can issue a work order to another player
        * This costs 1 coin
        * Later in the game (once Wine or Whiskey is being made) this changes to 2 coin
        * Can instead pay 1 wine or whiskey to the supply
    * Fell trees or cut peat
    * Build a building
      * Can immediately use your prior to use this building right away

    The following actions can be done as many times during your turn as you want:
    * Turn grain into straw
    * 1 coin to 5 coins (and vice versa) or wine/whiskey into coins
    * Buy landscapes
*** Settlement Phase
    1. Move building marker to next settlement phase
    2. Each player may build a max of 1 settlement from their supply
    3. Distribute the current letter's pile of buildings and settlements
*** 25th Bonus Round
    * Each player gets his prior back
    * Each player does one final action
      * Can build or use one building
      * Buildings being occupied don't matter
      * Can use other people's buildings without a work order with your prior
    * Then last settlement phase

** Setup
