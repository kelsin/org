* Agricola
** Notes
   * Uwe's first large game
   * Dethroned Puerto Rico as the number 1 game on Board Game Geek after a LONG
     reign
   * Seen as one of the most brutal of his games, hard to feed your family
   * Gets variability from the decks that you use for minor upgrades and
     occupations
   * I've played this game the most, but still only about 10 times total
** Goals
   The goal is to have the best farm after 12 rounds

   Points for many things:
   * Wheat and Vegetables (in ground or above)
   * Sheep, Pigs, and Cows
   * Negative points for unused farmland
   * Points for house tiles, more for upgraded (clay and stone)
   * Points for family members
   * Negative points for beggar cards
   * Points for upgrades and occupations
** Structure
*** 12 Rounds
    * Clockwise (starting with starting player) we place one worker at a time on
      an action space
    * Immediately take that action
    * Continue to the next person until all workers are placed
    * If you are out of workers you don't get any more actions
    * Each round resources spaces get more resources and one new action is added
      to the board
*** Harvest after round 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12
    * First get vegetables or wheat from any fields with plants in them
    * Then feed family. Each member needs 2 food, except newborns (from the
      previous round only) that need 1
    * Breed animals
** Setup
   * Each player gets a board and player colors
   * Each player gets two wood houses on their board
   * Shuffle the action cards and lay them face down on their spaces
   * Deal each player 7 occupations and 7 minor upgrades
