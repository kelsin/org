* Glass Road
** Notes
   * Second use of the Rondel (after Ora et Labora), but in a very different way
   * Released at the same time as Caverna so often overlooked
   * Much faster than most of his other games, box advertises 20 min per player
   * Gets variability from the card play and which buildings are available
   * Goal isn't always to clear and use up all of your land!
   * I've never played!

** Structure
*** Resources
    * Whenever you need to spend or gain a resource you move it on your rondel
    * Two of the resources are available on both rondels, which you choose is up
      to you
    * When the spinner on the rondel can move, it does, this DOES lead to wonky
      stuff
*** Buildings
    * Three types:
      * Immediate buildings that do an affect immediate
      * Buildings that give you a passive action
      * Buildings that score points at the end of the game based on other parts
        of the game
*** Rounds
    * Each round you pick 5 cards from your 15 (all players have the same cards)
      to be your hand
    * You all play
